# Club Icicle Client
README in development.
Cheers Rocket and Allinol for the base of the client!
## Current Versions
0.2.2 (Stable) | 1.0.0.1 (Beta, mostly available by compiling source)
## The Game
Club Icicle is a CPPS (Club Penguin Private Server) dedicated to having a fresh feel, while still being Nostalgic to those who played in the earlier days. Want to be a pizza chef? Check out the Pizza Parlor in the plaza! Want to be a Ninja? The dojo is your place to go! Enjoy helping others? Get experienced and visit the Tour Booth in the Ski Village! The possibilities are practically endless!
## The Music
The audio used in game is the exact same as that used in the original Club Penguin, right down to the SWFs. However, some music that did not exist within the original may be able to be encountered on the island, check out the Dojo for an example!
